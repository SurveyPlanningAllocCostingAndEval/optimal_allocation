      # Purpose
      p("The Bayesian Optimal Allocation app focuses on one of SPACE’s core goals — 
        helping survey teams allocate effort more effectively using evidence-based methods. 
        By combining probabilistic reasoning with real-world field constraints, it supports 
        survey design that is both efficient and transparent, while continuously learning 
        from results gathered in the field."

                     Uses Bayesian search allocation principles to distribute available 
                     survey effort across spatial units based on prior probabilities and 
                     survey parameters. This produces a daily field plan that optimizes

                     detections) to update probabilities and generate new priors for 
                     the next day’s allocation. This creates a self-correcting feedback

         sample-size determination. Each module is designed to interconnect with the others, 
         allowing archaeologists to move seamlessly from survey design to implementation 
         and quality assessment within a unified decision-support environment."

      p("Together, these capabilities support a more systematic and adaptive approach to 
        archaeological survey. The SPACE platform’s goal is to empower survey teams to plan,

        builds upon the knowledge gained from the last.")
